# üì¶ Spring Boot Project with JPA, MongoDB, and HTTP Security
This is a backend application built with **Spring Boot**, integrating both **JPA** and **MongoDB (local)** for data persistence. It uses **Spring Security** for HTTP-level security configuration and standardizes API responses using `ResponseEntity`.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Java 17+**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **Spring Data MongoDB**
- **MongoDB (local)**
- **Spring Security**
- **ResponseEntity**
- **Maven**

## üß© Features

- Full CRUD operations using both JPA and MongoDB
- Standardized HTTP responses with `ResponseEntity`
- Authentication and authorization configured via `HttpSecurity`
- Input validation and exception handling
- Separation of concerns with layered architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)

## üõ†Ô∏è Running Locally

1. Make sure MongoDB is running locally on the default port (`27017`).
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   cd your-project
   ```
